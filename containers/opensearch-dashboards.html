<b><h3>Usage Notes</h3></b>
<p/>
Exposed Ports: <pre><code>5601 5603</code></pre>

<p>Before running opensearch-dashboards, please be sure there is a running opensearch cluster to connect to - and place this file (or one you've edited) in a docker volume.</p>
<p>This file `opensearch-dashboards.yml` is responsible for configuring your connection to a running opensearch cluster. Find more on these settings and others at https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/install/tls/</p>
<p>Please note that 'admin' is the default username/password for the opensearch image offered by this container registry.</p>

<p><pre><code>server.host: "0.0.0.0"
opensearch.hosts: ["https://[host-ip-of-running-opensearch-cluster]:9200"]
opensearch.username: "admin" 
opensearch.password: "admin"
opensearch.ssl.verificationMode: none
logging.verbose: true
</pre></code>

<p>Once an opensearch cluster is running, and dashboards.yml is located in your created volume:</p>
<p><pre><code>docker run --name opensearch-dashboards -d -v [your-volume]/opensearch-dashboards.yml:config/opensearch-dashboards.yml -p 5600:5600 -p 5300:5300 icr.io/ibmz/opensearch-dashboards:[version]</code></pre></p>

<p>Verify that the connection has been established by either checking the logs or querying your host machine at port 5600:</p>
<p><pre><code>curl -u 'admin:admin' 'http://[host-ip]:5600'</code></pre></p>
