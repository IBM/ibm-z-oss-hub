<b><h3>Usage Notes</h3></b>
<p/>
Start the artifactory container with port <code>8081</code> exposed so that you can interact with Artifactory.

 <br><p><pre><code>docker run --name artifactory -p 8081:8081 -d icr.io/ibmz/jfrog-artifactory-oss:6.23.3</pre></code><br>

After waiting a minute for Artifactory to be ready, open the Artifactory UI from a web browser. If you are able to access the Artifactory web UI, that is an indication that Artifactory is working properly.
